Learn how to troubleshoot the various issues with the  Security Scan tool for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source.

## Issue: Unable to Submit the site

The Security Scan tool requires that you prove ownership of your site before the domain can be added to the Security Scan Tool. This can be performed by adding a confirmation code to your site using an HTML comment or the `<meta>` tag.

A common issue faced by merchants occurs when the Security Scan Tool is unable to confirm the merchant’s site ownership.

If you are getting an error and cannot submit your site for the scan, refer to the [Error message when adding sites into Security Scan](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/4531353024013) troubleshooting article in our support knowledge base.

## Issue: Empty reports generated by the Security Scan tool

You get an empty scan reports from the Security Scan tool.

### Solution

1. Check that 52.87.98.44, 34.196.167.176, and 3.218.25.102 IPs are not blocked at 80 and 443 ports.
1. Check the submitted URL for redirects (e.g., `https://mystore.com` redirects to `https://www.mystore.com` or vice versa or redirects to other domain names)
1. Investigate WAF/web server access logs for rejected/unfulfilled requests. HTTP 403 `Forbidden` and HTTP 500 `Internal server error` are the common server responses to generate the empty reports. Here's an example of the confirmation code that blocks requests by user agents:

```code block
if(req.http.user-agent ~ "(Chrome|Firefox)/[1-7][0-9]" && client.ip !~ useragent_allowlist)

{   error 403;   }
```

## Issue: Security issue resolved, but still showing as vulnerable in scan

The merchant resolved a security issue and is expecting their Security Scan to show that they are no longer vulnerable to the newly resolved issue. Instead, they find that the report generated by the Security Scan is still reporting that they are vulnerable to the security issue.

### Cause

Cloud instance metadata is gathered only for `active` and `live` Cloud Projects and is NOT a real-time process.

The statistics collection script is run once a day, then the Security Scan tool has to pick up the new data later.

The maximum expected sync-up cycle latency is up to a week and takes a minimum of 24 hours.

The following statuses could appear from checks:

1. **Unknown**: The Security Scan tool has no data about your domain yet; wait for the next sync-up cycle.
1. **Fail**: If the status shows fail, you'll need to fix the issue (enable 2FA, change admin URL, etc.) and wait for the next sync-up cycle.
1. **Staging vs. Production**: Since both staging and production instances share the same projectID, the "major" instance data overwrites the "minor" one. E.g., suppose the production instance is enabled and active. In that case, the `Cloud Metadata` check will show the "Applicable to Adobe Cloud `Production` instance only." message for the staging instance since Security Tool has the information only for the production instance.

If 24 hours have passed since the changes were made to the instance and they are not reflected in the Security Scan report, you can [submit a support ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000913794#submit-ticket). Provide the store URL when submitting the ticket.

## BotNet Suspect failure

The merchant receives a notification regarding a "BotNet Suspect" failure.

### Cause

1. The store domain name got into a "list" back in 2019, and it had the admin panel, downloader, or RSS functionality publicly exposed, and/or its URL has been mentioned in the CC skimming forums.
1. The alert could be caused by the signs of store compromise and/or malware, like JavaScript found on the page.
1. It is not necessarily an ongoing issue. If the store has been compromised previously, its hostname can still float around the dark web as a 'victim' name.
1. It might also be caused not by Adobe Commerce but by a system compromise (at the OS level).

### Solution

1. Check for newly created SSH accounts, filesystem changes, etc.
1. Perform a security review.
1. Check the Adobe Commerce version and upgrade, especially if it’s still running Magento 1, which is not supported anymore.
1. If the issue still persists, submit a support ticket and provide the store URL.

## Issue: Compromise Injection failure

The merchant receives an error regarding a "Compromise Injection" failure.

### Solution

1. Review the scripts indicated in the Security Scan Tool report.
1. Review home page source body for inline script injections.
1. Perform system configuration changes review, especially custom `HTML head` and `Miscellaneous HTML` in `footer` section values.
1. Perform code and database review for unfamiliar changes and signs of injected malware.

If none of the above helps, submit a support ticket and provide the store URL and error message from the report.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will the Security Scan affect performance on my website?

No. The Security Scan makes all requests one-by-one like a single user. Because of this, the Security Scan shouldn't affect website performance.

### How long does Adobe Commerce keep Security Scan reports?

You can generate the previous 10 reports from your end. If older reports are required, contact Adobe Commerce support. Up to a year of prior Security Scan reports can be obtained.

### What information is needed when submitting a support ticket?

Please make sure to provide the domain name.
