## Issue

Incorrect reservation compensation is created after a partial refund.

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Enable "In-Store Delivery" shipping method.
1. Create 3 inventory sources and make sure the pickup location is Active in each(source1, source2, source3)
1. Create new stock and assign these sources to the new stock
1. This stock should be assigned to the main website
1. Create a simple product - P3 assigning all the sources to it.
1. Add the following quantities for each source of this product and enable backorders for this product. Note: source2 has quantity 10
1. Add this product to cart from the frontend and proceed to shipping form.
1. Select "source1" as the shipping location.
1. Complete the order and executes the following query in the database:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM inventory_reservation WHERE sku = 'P3';
    ```
    You will get the order placed record in the `inventory_reservation` table. Qty is 10, which is correct.
1. Invoice this order from the backend.
1. Create a credit memo for only 1 product. DO NOT select *Return to Stock* checkbox.
1. Executes the same query from Step 9.

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

If we didn't select "Return to Stock" during credit memo creation, "inventory_reservation" table should not have a record corresponding to the credit memo.

<ins>Actual results</ins>:

Even though we didn't select "Return to Stock" during credit memo creation, it adds a record to "inventory_reservation" table with "creditmemo_created" event type. Also, we created the credit memo for only 1 quantity, but the credit memo record added in "inventory_reservation" table has quantity 10.
