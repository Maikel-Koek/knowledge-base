In order to provide you with the most up-to-date infrastructure foundation, we are migrating your Integration Environments to a new EU region. This migration will only affect your Integration Environments. There will be no Production downtime and no change to Stage or Production URLs.  

Once the migration is complete, you will need to update your repository address in your local repo as well as any third-party systems which you have integrated with the current Integration Environments.
