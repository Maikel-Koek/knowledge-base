In order to provide you with the most up-to-date infrastructure foundation, we are migrating your Integration Environments to a new region.

Please note that this migration is required prior to upgrading to Commerce 2.4.4.

## EU Region

We will be migrating your Integration Environments to a new EU region. This migration will only affect your Integration Environments. There will be no Production downtime and no change to Stage or Production URLs. Once the migration is complete, you will need to update your repository address in your local repo as well as any third-party systems which you have integrated with the current Integration Environments.

## US Region

We will be conducting an upgrade to the current US region that hosts your Integration Environments. This region update is required for the development support of Commerce 2.4.4. If you would like to begin upgrading to Commerce 2.4.4 in the interim, please contact Support and we will migrate your Integration environments to a compatible region. This migration will only affect the Integration Environments and there will be no Production downtime and no change to Stage or Production URLs. Once the migration is complete, you will need to update your repository address in your local repo as well as any third-party systems which you have integrated with the current Integration environments.
